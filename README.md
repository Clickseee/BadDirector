# Bad Director
A Balatro Mod heavily inspired by the idea of Misprint Joker from the base game and TMTRAINER from The Binding of Isaac, and also a bunch of Vanilla-esque Balatro Mods
> THIS MOD IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, ANYTHING IS NOT FINAL!!!

This mod currently adds:
- New consumables set: Misprint Consumables
- 6 New Enhancements
- 4 New Seals
- 2 New Editions
- 1 New Deck
- And more to come

# Installation
### let me put it in the most simplest way so that even a five years old can understand
**YOU** need to have both Lovely and Steammodded (Version 1.0.0-beta-0827c or later) to be installed in **YOUR** copy of Balatro.
(See: [Steamodded Installation](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki#i-want-to-play-with-mods), [Lovely Installation](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-installation))

**AFTER** that, drag the files from the **LATEST** release and put it in your Mods folder (%APPDATA%\Balatro\Mods)

i **GOTTA** remind you again: **THIS MOD IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT** meaning it has bugs and contents are not final
